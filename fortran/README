This directory contains Fortran wrappers to the FINUFFT C++ library,
and older test codes unchanged from the CMCL NUFFT library apart from
that they call the FINUFFT library.

The interfaces are identical to those of CMCL (ie drop-in replacements).
The naming is:
finufftndm_f(...)  where n=dimensions (1,2 or 3) and m=type (1,2 or 3).

Note that, on a linux system, to link your Fortran against the FINUFFT C++
library, you may want to use g++, with the -lgfortran at the *end* of the
compile statement.

See ../makefile
Eg
(cd ..; make fortran)
