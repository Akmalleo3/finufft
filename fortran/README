This directory contains Fortran wrappers to the FINUFFT C++ library,
and older test codes unchanged from the CMCL NUFFT library apart from
that they call the FINUFFT library.

Note that to link your Fortran against the FINUFFT C++ library, you may
want to use g++ (on a linux system) with the -lgfortran at the *end* of the
compile statement.

See ../makefile
Eg
(cd ..; make fortran)
