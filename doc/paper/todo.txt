* think about changing the 1/M definition in type-1. Surely is messy,
so t-2 and t-1 not adjoints, etc.
Check w/ Leslie. Change in paper and code.

* check signs of t-1,2,3 by default, and adj of 1 is 2.

* run time vs # threads (strong scaling).

* Time vs N size, error vs N size, as Townsend.

* compare checkerboard blocking vs current z-axis.

* ask/find out why NFFT takes 50 sec to plan a 200^3 modes case!
Put in the paper graphs.
Make sure we're using right precomputation mode - try PRE_PSI vs PRE_FULL_PSI.
Could it be the FFTW_ESTIMATE?

* Volkmer - openmp for nfft.
Potts 2003 claims to introduce K-B to NFFT.
But surely known in med img / MRI ? Jackson is 1991.

* Ferrara nufft code cite. Has no type-3.



THOUGHTS / IMPROVEMENTS:

* note in code, kernel is on [-w/2,w/2], but in paper it's [-1,1] for
simplicity.

* could skip a rescaling step by allowing a general domain scale in
cnufftspread, rather than [0,N] or [-pi,pi]. If allowed [-A,A],
could avoid one round of rescaling.

* switch off C1 etc shift in t-3 when <0.1 X1, etc.

---------- done:

* analysis for K-B refs - emailed Potts (others bounced) - got the info.

* our analysis - sum of tail? too hard
