* check signs of t-1,2,3 by default, and adj of 1 is 2.

* run time vs # threads (strong scaling)

* compare checkerboard blocking vs current z-axis.

* analysis for K-B refs - emailed Potts (others bounced) - got the info.

* ask/find out why NFFT takes 50 sec to plan a 200^3 modes case!
Put in the paper graphs.
Make sure we're using right precomputation mode - try PRE_PSI vs PRE_FULL_PSI.
Could it be the FFTW_ESTIMATE?


* our analysis - sum of tail?

* Volkmer - openmp for nfft.
Potts 2003 claims to introduce K-B to NFFT.
But surely known in med img / MRI ? Jackson is 1991.
