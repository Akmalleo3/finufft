C/C++:
100000000 C-type double mults in 0.127 s
100000000 C++ std vector double mults in 0.129 s
100000000 C-type doubles by hand (sep storage) mults in 0.295 s
100000000 C-type doubles by hand complex mults in 0.255 s
100000000 C-type complex mults in 0.367 s
Fortran:
 100000000 fortran real*8 mults in  0.124 s
 100000000 fortran complex*16 mults in  0.256 s

# conclusion: fortran and hand-coding C are equal for complex.
