Compile the library using:

make

This should compile the main libraries and print a list of further
make options.  If you have an error then `cp makefile makefile.local`,
edit `makefile.local` to adjust compiler and other library options,
and use `make -f makefile.local`.

Here are some other make tasks:

- `make examples` : compile the demos in `examples/`
- `make test` : mathematical validation of the library and components
- `make perftest` : multi-threaded and single-threaded performance tests
- `make fortran` : compile and test the fortran interfaces  

Linking to the library: to link to the static library
`lib/libfinufft.a` use the compiler flag `-Llib/libfinufft.a` (or
replacing this by the absolute location of this library). In your
C/C\++ code you will need to include the header `src/finufft.h`.
