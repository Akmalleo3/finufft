Linux/unix installation notes for FINUFFT. 3/14/17

DEPENDENCIES:

For the basic libraries

- C++ compiler such as g++
- FFTW3
- GNU make
- numdiff
- Optionally, OpenMP (however, the makefile can be adjusted for single-threaded operation)

For the Fortran wrappers

- Fortran compiler such as gfortran (see settings in the makefile)

On a Fedora/CentOS linux system, these dependencies can be installed as follows:

sudo yum install make gcc gcc-c++ gcc-gfortran fftw3 fftw3-devel libgomp numdiff

On Ubuntu linux:

sudo apt-get install make build-essential libfftw3-dev gfortran numdiff


COMPILATION:

Compile the library using

make

This should compile the main libraries and print a list of further
make options.  If you have an error then `cp makefile makefile.local`,
edit `makefile.local` to adjust compiler and other library options,
and use `make -f makefile.local`.

Here are some other make tasks:

- `make examples` : compile the demos in `examples/`
- `make test` : mathematical validation of the library and components
- `make perftest` : multi-threaded and single-threaded performance tests
- `make fortran` : compile and test the fortran interfaces  

Linking to the library: to link to the static library
`lib/libfinufft.a` use the compiler flag `-Llib/libfinufft.a` (or
replacing this by the absolute location of this library). In your
C/C\++ code you will need to include the header `src/finufft.h`.
