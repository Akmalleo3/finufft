## Accuracy and speed tests using the python wrappers

To install the python (or python3) wrappers for finufft, see ../finufftpy/README.md

Then you may run the tests as follows

```
python3 run_accuracy_tests.py
python3 run_speed_tests.py
```

The code `accuracy_speed_tests.py` illustrates how to call FINUFFT from python.
