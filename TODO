List of items to do for FINUFFT library

* MAC OSX test, makefile, instructions.
* test non-openmp compile. Decide if non vs omp get different lib names.
* make common.cpp shuffle routines dcomplex interface and native dcomplex arith (remove a bunch of 2* in indexing, and have no fftw_complex refs in them. However, need first to make sure using complex divide isn't slower than real divide used now). Fix the calling from finufft?d?
* theory work on exp(sqrt) being close to PSWF
* figure out why bottom out ~ 1e-10 err for big arrays in 1d. unavoidable roundoff? small arrays get to 1e-14.
* Checkerboard per-thread grid cuboids, compare speed in 2d and 3d against current 1d slicing. See cnufftspread:set_thread_index_box()
* decide to cut down intermediate copies of input data eg xj -> xp -> xjscal -> xk2 to save RAM in large problems?
* single-prec compile option for RAM-intensive problems? priority?
* test BIGINT -> long long slows any array access down, or spreading? allows I/O sizes (M, N1*N2*N3) > 2^31. Note June-Yub int*8 in nufft-1.3.x slowed things by factor 2-3.
* matlab wrappers, mcwrap issue w/ openmp, mex, and subdirs. Ship mex executables for linux, osx, etc. Link to .a
* matlab wrappers need ier output? think
* test wrappers in octave
* python wrappers - alert Dan Foreman-Mackey re https://github.com/dfm/python-nufft
* proper FI license
* release, outreach, users, NA-Digest
* doc/manual
* boilerplate stuff as in CMCL page
* clean up tree, remove devel and unused contrib
* Flatiron logo
* github.io webpage
* Currently, if a large product of x width and k width is requested in type 3 transforms, no check is done before attempting to malloc ridiculous array sizes. Fix this.
* package RPM and .deb for linux
* figure out how to set up path to link to shared library - rpath?
* make C interface example1d1c cleaner, ie remove _Complex, why needs g++ to compile?
* extend dumbinputs to 2d, 3d.
